The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project
The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project was designed to provide a flexible base for building various web-enabled micro-controller projects on. Using the powerful ESP32 S3,
it offers 240MHz and 320KB RAM. Depending on the ESP32 S3 module used, 4-32MB of Flash is available. The ESP32 S3 offers built-in WiFi and Bluetooth support. The
asynchronous library used allows up to 8 WiFi clients to be connected simultaneously. It supports HTML and WebSockets.
The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project is divided into hardware and software sections which can each be used independently or combined to provide the synergy to get a
project up and running quickly. The project provides the necessary infrastructure for a wide range of simple to complex IOT projects. Using The ESP32 S3 Webserver
Project allows you to concentrate on the individual aspects of your project without having to worry about the web server infrastructure. The ESP32 S3 Webserver
Project hardware can be used for rapid prototyping as well as in finished projects without the need of building the hardware twice.
While not absolutely necessary to use the software, The ESP32 S3 Web Server Project hardware makes it easier by providing breakouts and connectors for many things.
The board has been designed as a standalone or to attach to the back of a 3.5 inch TFT Display, with or without a touchscreen. The board provides connectors for
5V in/out, 3.3V in/out, I2C, SPI SD/SDHC card (or connect to one already on the TFT display), SD/SDXC MMC card, TX/RX Port, USB Port, reset button, and boot button.
A standard SPI port is also provided for additional SPI devices.
The ESP32 S3 Webserver Project software supports Over the Air (OTA) flashing, SD and/or LittleFS (file storage in flash memory), connectivity as an access point
and WiFi, client-side webpage caching, a local timezone including daylight savings time where appropriate, time synching over the internet, an Admin, File Manager
and Status webpage, Serial Monitor support over a webpage, WebSockets and sending/receiving Telegram messages.
